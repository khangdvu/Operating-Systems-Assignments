# Operating-Systems-Assignments

These are my work for CMPT 300, Operating Systems, at SFU.
The specifics of each assignment are not included for fear of easy copying of future students.
In a nutshell, the assignments are as follows:
Prj1: Create a library for working with strings and linked lists.
Prj2: Create a program that acts like a Linux Shell.
Prj3: Create a threading program simulating factories creating candies and children consuming them simultaneously.
